The Characters page is rendered Server-Side and shows a list of Rick and Morty characters. From there, you can click each character to follow a Statically-Generated path, and visit Character page rendering with Static-Site-Generation. I've fetched the data for these pages from a REST API.

The Episodes page is rendered Client-Side. I've used a filtered GraphQL query to fetch the data.
